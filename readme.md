# Project Title: Full Stack Web Application 
### with `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, `Express.js`, and `Server-Side Rendering`

## Overview
üöÄ Excited to share my latest project! I‚Äôve built an advanced full stack web application featuring user authentication and post management using Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and server-side rendering. This project allows users to register, log in, create and manage posts, like posts, and more‚Äîall while ensuring secure access through protected routes.

A big shoutout to Harsh Sir from Sheryians Coding School on YouTube for the amazing tutorials that guided me through this process.
This project is a full-featured web application built using Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and server-side rendering.
